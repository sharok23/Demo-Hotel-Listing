Step 1: Set Up the Project Locally

Clone the Repository (if it's on a version control platform like GitHub).
Open the Project in Visual Studio or another IDE that supports .NET.

Step 2: Check Dependencies and Build the Project

Restore NuGet Packages:

In Visual Studio, right-click on the solution in Solution Explorer and select "Restore NuGet Packages."
Make sure you have all required packages, including:

AutoMapper.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
Serilog.AspNetCore
Serilog.Sinks.Seq
Swashbuckle.AspNetCore for Swagger documentation
Build the Project to ensure there are no errors in the setup.

Step 3: Configure Database Connection

Check the Connection String:

Open appsettings.json and locate "ConnectionStrings": { "HotelListingDbConnectionString" }.
Update this connection string with the correct values if you need to connect to a specific SQL Server instance.
Run Migrations to Set Up the Database:

Open the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio.
Run Update-Database to apply the migration (SeededCountriesAndHotels) and initialize the database with seeded data.

Step 4: Review Entity Models and DTOs

Entities: Look at Country and Hotel models in HotelListing.API.NET5.Data. These represent the database tables.
DTOs:

Review the DTO classes (CountryDto, CreateCountryDto, GetCountryDto, UpdateCountryDto, and HotelDto) in the Models folder. These are used to transfer data between the client and server.

Step 5: Review Repositories and Services

Generic Repository (GenericRepository<T>): Provides basic CRUD operations.
Countries Repository (CountriesRepository): Extends the generic repository and includes a custom method, GetDetails(int id), for fetching country details with associated hotels.

Step 6: Set Up Dependency Injection in Startup.cs

In Startup.cs, make sure all required services are registered, especially:

Database Context: HotelListingDbContext with SQL Server
Repositories: CountriesRepository and GenericRepository
Serilog for logging
Swagger for API documentation

Step 7: Run the Project and Test with Swagger

Run the Application: Press F5 in Visual Studio or dotnet run from the command line.
Open Swagger: Visit https://localhost:5001/swagger (or the designated Swagger URL) to see the API documentation and interact with endpoints.

Step 8: Test the API Endpoints

Countries Endpoint: Test the CRUD operations for Country by adding, updating, retrieving, and deleting country records.
Hotels Endpoint: Check the related hotel data to confirm that countries and hotels are associated correctly in the database.

Step 9: Set Up Logging with Serilog (Optional for Debugging)

Review Program.cs and appsettings.json for Serilog setup, which outputs logs to files and Seq if configured.
Logs can help in debugging errors or tracking information on requests.
